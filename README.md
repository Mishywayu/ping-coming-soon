# #Frontend Challenge
## Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The Challenge
The challenge was to build out the Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


Users should be able to: 
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. ❌ (I couldn't manage to make it responsive on the mobile screen).
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. ✅
- Submit their email address using an `input` field. ✅
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"* ✅
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"* ✅


## How I wne about this project.
1. I looked through the design and started planning out how I will tackle the project.
2. I structured the contented with HTML the added the styles with CSS, then the email validation with Javascript.
3. I initialized the project as a public repository on Github.
